          <published>2018-07-29T17:00:00.000-07:00</published>
          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce the availability of Lagom 1.5.0-M2 (we skipped Lagom 1.5.0-M1 due to an issue with the release process). This is the first milestone towards the releasing of Lagom 1.5.0 which moves Lagom closer to Play and Akka. This release includes Play 2.7.0-M2 and lays the groundwork for gRPC support in future 1.5.0 milestones with Akka Service Discovery integration.</p>
<p>The motivation behind moving Lagom closer to Play and Akka is twofold: Play and Akka users will be able to adopt Lagom more easily by reusing existing code or APIs they are already familiar with, and framework maintainers will reduce the amount of code to maintain and converge in conventions speeding up the development process.</p>
<p>Note that this should not be used in production, that Lightbend Orchestration (sbt-reactive-app) does not yet support Lagom 1.5.0-M2, and that ConductR will not be supported for Lagom 1.5.0. Also note that this is an unsupported, pre-release milestone and we don&rsquo;t guarantee API stability or binary compatibility between milestones.</p>
<h2><a href="#highlights" name="highlights">Highlights</a></h2>
<h3>Updates Play to 2.7.x</h3>
<p>Lagom 1.5.0-M2 bumps the Play version to <a href="https://blog.playframework.com/play-2-7-0-m2-released/">2.7.0-M2</a> (see also <a href="https://blog.playframework.com/play-2-7-0-milestone-1-released/">2.7.0-M1</a>). Play now exposes the <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown">Akka Coordinated Shutdown</a> instance as a first class citizen so you can register your shutdown code using it instead of using Play&rsquo;s <code>ApplicationLifecycle</code>.</p>
<p>The version of Akka HTTP powering the default HTTP Backend for both Play and Lagom was bumped to <a href="https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/03/08/akka-http-10.1.0-released">10.1</a>.</p>
<p>Upgrading to Play 2.7 may cause some errors on your code as some deprecated APIs were removed (please review the <a href="https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/master/documentation/manual/releases/release27/migration27/Migration27.md">Play 2.7 Migration Guide</a> or the release announcements linked above). Play also updated the Jackson library (for java JSON serialization) to 2.9.6 which includes reviewed defaults so you may need to check your serializer settings. The changes in Jackson default settings may not cause compilation errors so we recommend you exercise your serializers in tests to detect any potential issue.</p>
<h3><a href="#grpc-service-discovery-and-more" name="grpc-service-discovery-and-more">gRPC, Service Discovery and more</a></h3>
<p>We are laying groundwork for integration with <a href="https://github.com/akka/akka-grpc">Akka gRPC</a> to add it as a transport alternative, allowing seamless communication between applications written using Akka, Play, Lagom and other stacks using gRPC.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-management/current/discovery.html">Akka&rsquo;s Service Discovery</a> will become a building block of Lagom&rsquo;s <code>ServiceLocator</code> and help standardize service discovery scenarios. This will simplify production settings to tune cluster bootstrap and other service discovery strategies and combine them. Lagom 1.5.0-M2 started the refactor process to move to an implementation that&rsquo;s based 100% on Akka&rsquo;s Service Discovery. This new library provides an extensible API for looking up service addresses by name from within Akka-based services, including integration with Kubernetes, Marathon, Consul, and others. It is similar to Lagom&rsquo;s ServiceLocator API, but can be used in any Akka or Play application, as well as in Lagom. It is a foundational building block for many of the upcoming cross-product features, including gRPC support, and with this release it works seamlessly in Lagom&rsquo;s runAll development mode without additional configuration. We are planning to integrate this more fully with Lagom in future 1.5.0 milestones and beyond.</p>
<p>This cross-product collaboration is the first of many more to come. The motivation is to allow users developers to more naturally reuse code between Akka, Play and Lagom. The promotion of Akka Coordinated Shutdown mentioned above is another example of this effort to provide more coherent APIs.</p>
<h3><a href="#other-improvements" name="other-improvements">Other improvements</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Updates Alpakka Kafka to version <a href="https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/releases">0.22</a>. This also includes a version upgrade of the Kafka Server embedded in Development Mode to 1.0.1.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Improves Development Mode settings so each service can choose what network interface to bind to, which is particularly useful in some OS or corporate environments where VPNs or proxies can interfere with inter-service communication. The new default for all services is to listen only on the loopback address <code>127.0.0.1</code> by default, which has better compatibility, but disallows communication from other hosts on the network. This can be configured to use another address if you need to share a Lagom development environment on a local network. Every service run in Developer Mode has slightly different settings, see the docs for <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/latest/java/ServiceLocator.html#Default-address1">Service Gateway</a>, <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/latest/java/ServiceLocator.html#Default-address">Service Locator</a> or <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/latest/java/ConfiguringServicesInDevelopment.html#How-are-addresses-bound-by-services?">your services</a>.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Many documentation improvements, especially to remove deprecated APIs in code examples.</p></li>

<h2>Updating a Lagom project to version 1.4.5</h2>
<p>To update an sbt project, change the version of <code>lagom-sbt-plugin</code> in your <code>project/plugins.sbt</code> file.</p>
<p>To update a Maven project, change the <code>lagom.version</code> property in your top-level <code>pom.xml</code>.</p>
<p>After updating, it is recommended to fix any new deprecation warnings you see when compiling or running your services.</p>
<h2>Updating to sbt 1.x</h2>
<p>Support for sbt 1.x was quietly released with Lagom 1.4.0, but at the time we had not yet thoroughly tested it with Lagom, so we did not yet document this support or recommend it for most users.</p>
<p>Some adventurous users have been using it since then, and in the meantime we have updated all of our example applications and new project templates. Since we haven&rsquo;t encountered any new problems with sbt 1.x, we now recommend it for all users of Lagom with sbt.</p>
<p>You can update the sbt version in the <code>project/build.properties</code> file. The most recent version at the time of this writing is <a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2018-05-09-sbt-1-1-5-patch-release/">1.1.5</a>.</p>
<p>You might also need to update other plugins, global configuration, or custom build configuration. See the <a href="https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Migrating-from-sbt-013x.html">sbt documentation</a> for details on migrating from version 0.13.x.</p>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Lagom team has released Lagom 1.4.4.<br/>(we are skipping 1.4.3 due to a small mistake in the release process)</p>
<p>This release provides a fix for <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1250">#1250</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1250">#1250</a> only affects Lagom projects making usage of JDBC persistence layer, being it for the journal and/or for read-side tables. </p>
<p>This release upgrades the versions of the underlying Slick library to <code>3.2.3</code> and the <code>akka-persistence-jdbc</code> plugin to version <code>3.3.0</code>.</p>
<h2>Slick 3.2.3 special note</h2>
<p>Since Slick 3.2.2, the <code>maxConnections</code> must equal <code>numThreads</code>. This is to prevent some situations where a deadlock could occur. A warning will be emitted in case <code>maxConnections &gt; numThreads</code> and a runtime exception will be thrown if <code>maxConnections &lt; numThreads</code>. Therefore the best possible configuration is <code>maxConnections == numThreads</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/slick/slick/pull/1855">slick/slick#1855</a> for detailed information.</p>
<p>These values are configured by Lagom automatically under the configuration key <code>db.default.async-executor</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>db.default {
  async-executor {
    # number of objects that can be queued by the async executor
    queueSize = 10000
    
    # 5 * number of cores
    numThreads = 20

    # same as number number of threads
    minConnections = 20

    # same as number of threads
    maxConnections = 20
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t changed the settings for your <code>async-executor</code>, you have nothing to do. However, if you have configured your <code>aync-executor</code> with other values, you should review it and make sure that <code>maxThreads == maxConnections</code>.</p>
<p>See GitHub for the <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/compare/1.4.2...1.4.4">full list of commits</a> and the issues and pull requests assigned to the <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/milestone/29?closed=1">1.4.4 milestone</a>.</p>
<h2>Updating a Lagom project to version 1.4.4</h2>
<p>To update an sbt project, change the version of <code>lagom-sbt-plugin</code> in your <code>project/plugins.sbt</code> file.</p>
<p>To update a Maven project, change the <code>lagom.version</code> property in your top-level <code>pom.xml</code>.</p>
<p>After updating, it is recommended to fix any new deprecation warnings you see when compiling or running your services.</p>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the Lagom project has grown in usage, one of the biggest barriers to adoption that we&rsquo;ve seen is Lagom&rsquo;s opinionated approach to using event sourcing for persistence. Many developers looking to write reactive microservices come from a <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud">CRUD</a> background, often using relational databases to store data.</p>
<p>Lagom&rsquo;s service API can be used alongside CRUD-style persistence - you can easily use any persistence technology available on the JVM in Lagom. However, the Lagom persistence APIs do not offer CRUD as a first class option, and the <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/java/PersistentEntity.html">Lagom documentation</a> pushes users in the direction of event sourcing.</p>
<p>To be honest, event sourcing does generally require writing more code up front than CRUD. Lagom does not push event sourcing because it reduces the amount of code. Lagom pushes event sourcing because the problems that microservices introduce - such as ensuring consistency between services - are very easily solved when you are using event sourcing for persistence, and very hard to solve when you&rsquo;re using CRUD for persistence. A service using CRUD might have less code to start with, but as soon as it starts sharing data with other services, problems relating to handling failures and synchronisation of state become very difficult problems to solve, and will often require implementing complex solutions, including manual state and failure tracking. In fact, in my experience of using CRUD, dealing with these problems usually requires manually implementing event logs and asynchronous batch processes to handle them, so developers end up implementing both event sourcing and CRUD, which is far more code and far harder to maintain. In contrast, event sourcing inherently deals with these problems as a property of the architectural approach, with no special code implemented by developers.</p>
<p>Put simply, using event sourcing over CRUD is an investment of more code and effort up front, but will yield a simpler, more resilient and easier to maintain system in the future. Lets take a look at how this looks in practice.</p>
<p>A few months ago I had the chance to speak about this topic at the Reactive Summit&rsquo;17. Here&rsquo;s the recording of the talk.</p>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce a new way to communicate with the Lagom community: <a href="https://discuss.lagomframework.com">discuss.lagomframework.com</a>.</p>
<p>It is a <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> forum sponsored by <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/">Lightbend</a>, and co-hosted under the discuss.lightbend.com domain, along with discuss.playframework.com and discuss.akka.io. Each of these domains redirects you to the main category for the corresponding project, so you can go directly to the Lagom discussions by using the discuss.lagomframework.com shortcut, without having to navigate through the entire list of all categories. At the same time, discussions relating to the foundational technologies that Lagom is built on are right within reach on the same site. This will make it simpler for the Akka, Play, and Lagom communities to learn from each other and share ideas.</p>
<p>To further explain what&rsquo;s going to happen next to the other communication channels, and what their intended use is:</p>
<h2>What happens to the lagom-framework mailing list?</h2>
<p>The lagom-framework mailing list on Google Groups will be transitioned into a read-only mode. It will not happen immediately, but we&rsquo;ll try to direct all new questions to the new forum, and eventually flip the switch to mark lagom-framework as a read-only archive.</p>
<p>We took this decision after much thought, debate and considering the various up and down sides of handling it very seriously. We know that a mailing list work-flow is very precious for people used to working with them (plenty of us including), however in order to grow the community as a whole, and also help making the discussions on such forum more searchable and accessible, we decided that this move will be beneficial for everyone involved.</p>
<p>If you enjoy working with mailing lists, and would like to continue to do so with the new forums, please have a look at the <a href="https://discuss.lightbend.com/c/meta">hints in the Discuss Meta topics</a>, where we prepared hints on how to set up the <a href="https://discuss.lightbend.com/t/how-to-use-the-discuss-forum-as-a-mailing-list/61">notifications to work as-if a mailing list</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-happens-to-the-gitter-channels-" name="what-happens-to-the-gitter-channels-">What happens to the Gitter channels?</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://gitter.im/lagom/lagom">Lagom Gitter room</a> and <a href="https://gitter.im/lagom/contributors">Lagom contributors Gitter room</a> will remain as real-time chat channels, but we suggest posting questions in discuss.lagomframework.com if you don&rsquo;t get a quick response. With the Lagom community and maintainer team distributed around the world, not everyone can take part in a conversation on Gitter at the same time. With Gitter&rsquo;s linear and conversational format, it can be hard to keep track of concurrent discussions, and it&rsquo;s easy to miss messages. The new forum will make it much easier to keep track of the conversations you are interested in, and ignore the ones you aren&rsquo;t. Asynchronous communication is not just for microservices!</p>
<h2><a href="#what-other-community-channels-are-there-" name="what-other-community-channels-are-there-">What other community channels are there?</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lagom">Stack Overflow</a> is still a great place to ask specific programming questions about Lagom, especially when they also relate to other technologies that are not part of discuss.lightbend.com. Stack Overflow has a huge community, and the Lagom maintainer team continues to monitor the &ldquo;lagom&rdquo; tag on it. However, Stack Overflow has a strict Q&amp;A format and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">rules about what is considered on-topic</a>. It is not suitable for opinion-based questions, announcements, or open-ended discussion.</li>
  <li>Of course, <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom">GitHub</a> is the center for collaboration on development of Lagom itself, and the <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues">issue tracker</a> is the best place to report reproducible bugs and propose new features. If you&rsquo;re having a problem and you&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s caused by a bug in Lagom, please ask for help on discuss.lagomframework.com before creating an issue on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#what-if-i-want-urgent-24-7-support-" name="what-if-i-want-urgent-24-7-support-">What if I want urgent 24/7 support?</a></h2>
<p>Nothing changes in this aspect. The public communication channels were always best-effort, although we and the community do try to help as much as possible. If you really want the best-in-class, most responsive answers and support, the <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/subscription">Lightbend Subscription</a> offers professional development and production support, along with access to consulting services, training, the <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/products/enterprise-suite">Lightbend Enterprise Suite</a> of commercial software, and other benefits.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that the move to the &ldquo;discuss&rdquo; forum (as we like to call it) is not the same as commercial support, however we do hope to serve our communities better by making this move. We do not envision any negative impact on the quality of the answers you have been receiving on Gitter and lagom-framework by this move to the new forums.</p>
<p>We hope you&rsquo;re as excited about the new discussion forums as we are. We look forward to you joining us there!</p>]]></content>
