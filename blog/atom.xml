          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce the availability of Lagom 1.5.0. This is the GA release of Lagom 1.5.0 and is production ready. We invite all our users to upgrade.</p>
<p>This version builds on top of the <a href="https://blog.playframework.com/play-2-7-0-is-here/">2.7.x series of Play</a>, <a href="https://akka.io/blog/news/2019/02/28/alpakka-kafka-1.0-released">Alpakka Kafka 1.0</a>, and the latest improvements on Akka and Akka Management. See GitHub for the <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/compare/1.4.11...1.5.0">full list of commits</a>. </p>
<p>Here’s a list of the most relevant improvements.</p>
<h2><a href="#akka-management" name="akka-management">Akka Management</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-management/current/">Akka Management</a> is a suite of tools for operating Akka powered applications. Akka Management uses a dedicated HTTP port to expose a few routes allowing remote inspection of the state of the Akka Actor System. For example, if the process is a member of an Akka Cluster, these endpoints will report if the node already joined the cluster.</p>
<p>Lagom exposes the Akka Management HTTP port out of the box. Lagom will add Health Check routes by default. You can reuse library provided health checks or plugin your own. For example, Lagom uses cluster status to determine when the node is healthy. This is called Cluster Membership Check and is provided by the Akka Cluster HTTP Management library.</p>
<p>Another improvement Lagom 1.5 introduces, thanks to the adoption of Akka Management, is the simpler, <strong>more robust cluster formation via <a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-management/current/bootstrap/">Akka Cluster Bootstrap</a></strong>. Instead of using a static list of seed nodes or relying on convoluted custom scripts to build the list of seed nodes dynamically, Cluster Bootstrap discovers the existing nodes via plugins adapting Akka Cluster Bootstrap to your orchestration environment (e.g. Kubernetes, Marathon). A static list of seed nodes is still supported but we recommend migrating to Cluster Bootstrap.</p>
<h2><a href="#deployment-with-kubernetes-or-red-hat-openshift" name="deployment-with-kubernetes-or-red-hat-openshift">Deployment with Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift</a></h2>
<p>Lagom 1.5.0 will no longer support Lightbend Orchestration (which was <a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/reactive-platform/2.0/support-terminology/index.html#incubating">Incubating</a>). Despite accelerating the first deployment, using Lightbend Orchestration was producing friction and reducing flexibility to tune the deployment. Moving forward, there will be no automated handling of the deployment and the suggested way is to manually maintain the production settings, the deployment descriptors and related scripts.</p>
<p>If you are targeting OpenShift or Kubernetes environments the new <a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/openshift-deployment/">Guide to Deploy Lightbend Applications</a> covers all the steps and details (including a sample application) to set up and tune your system.</p>
<h2><a href="#akka-grpc-integration" name="akka-grpc-integration">Akka gRPC integration</a></h2>
<p>Lagom 1.5.0 introduces <a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/lightbend-platform/2.0/support-terminology/index.html#incubating">incubating</a> support for <a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-grpc/current/">Akka gRPC</a> for cross-service communication. The original HTTP/JSON-based transport is not disappearing but, instead, Lagom introduces gRPC so users can choose to expose alternative transports increasing the adoption of their services.</p>
<p>This feature drove some smaller improvements which non-gRPC users will also welcome.<br/>Lagom already supported HTTP/2 since it is built on top of Play. In Lagom 1.5 we’ve reviewed all the necessary pieces so HTTP/2 can also be used on dev mode. In the same spirit, it is now also possible to use encrypted (TLS) communication on dev mode. </p>
<p>As a final improvement driven by the adoption of gRPC, Lagom 1.5 now supports Additional Routers (<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.5.x/java/AdditionalRouters.html">Java API</a> / <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.5.x/scala/AdditionalRouters.html">Scala API</a>), which lets you embed any vanilla Play Router into a Lagom service. You are now able to easily reuse the Play and Akka building blocks whenever the Lagom API is not enough to complete the task at hand. Using Additional Routers it is trivial to reuse Play code you already had or extend Lagom with low-level features supported in Play but not exposed in Lagom directly (such as uploading files).</p>
<h2><a href="#couchbase-persistence-support" name="couchbase-persistence-support">Couchbase Persistence Support</a></h2>
<p>Lagom 1.5 also offers optional support for <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a> as a new database option for persistent entities and read side processors through the <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-couchbase/current/">Akka Persistence Couchbase</a> module. Currently available in an <a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/lightbend-platform/2.0/support-terminology/index.html#incubating">Incubating</a> early access release, Akka Persistence Couchbase has been built to work with Lagom 1.5 and the 1.0 release is coming soon. See the documentation for <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-couchbase/current/lagom-persistent-entity.html">Couchbase Persistent Entities</a> and <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-couchbase/current/lagom-read-side.html">Couchbase Read-Side support</a> for more details.</p>
<h2><a href="#migrating-from-previous-versions" name="migrating-from-previous-versions">Migrating from previous versions</a></h2>
<p>This release introduces very little changes over the <code>1.5.0-RC2</code> so if you already moved to that version the upgrade should be trivial. If you are still using Lagom <code>1.4.x</code> we recommend you first migrate to the latest version available of Lagom 1.4 series and then migrate to Lagom 1.5. If you are using a version older than <code>1.4.x</code>, you should migrate one version at a time. For example: from <code>1.3.9</code> to <code>1.3.11</code> (because <code>1.3.11</code> is <code>1.3.latest</code>), then from <code>1.3.11</code> to <code>1.4.latest</code> and finally to <code>1.5.x</code>. Read the appropriate <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/releases">release notes</a> and migration guides (<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/latest/java/Migration15.html">Java</a> / <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/latest/scala/Migration15.html">Scala</a>) on each step.</p>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce the availability of Lagom 1.5.0-RC2. This is the second release candidate of Lagom 1.5.0. We expect this to be considerably more stable than the milestone releases, not only in terms of functionality but we are also moving closer to the idea of freezing the APIs. Our plan is to later promote this release candidate to a stable release if we don&rsquo;t find major issues.</p>
<p>Because of that, and as with milestones, the primary goal is to get feedback, so please let us know if something isn&rsquo;t working or you see something that should be improved. If there are changes not well documented in javadocs, scaladocs or our migration guides, please, let us know so that we can improve them before the general availability release.</p>
<h2><a href="#highlights" name="highlights">Highlights</a></h2>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Lagom team has released Lagom 1.4.9.</p>
<p>This release provides a few bug fixes and an improvement.</p>
<h2><a href="#highlights" name="highlights">Highlights</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Updates Akka to <a href="https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/10/07/akka-2.5.18-released">2.5.18</a>. This Akka release introduces few improvements on the DNS implementation. It also improves the cluster membership handling so if you are using Akka&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-commercial-addons/current/split-brain-resolver.html">Split Brain Resolver</a> you may want to upgrade.</li>
  <li>Updates Akka HTTP to <a href="https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/09/06/akka-http-10.1.5-10.0.14-security-fix-released">10.0.14</a> with an important security fix. It&rsquo;s is unlikely that as a Lagom user you were exposed to the vulnerability, though.</li>
  <li>Updates Play to <a href="https://blog.playframework.com/play-2-6-20-released/">2.6.20</a> with some minor improvements.</li>
  <li>Fixes <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1557">a regression</a> on <code>LagomClientFactory</code> introduced on the <code>1.4.x</code> series which was causing a <code>LagomClientFactory</code> running inside a Lagom service to interfere with the service in some scenarios causing failures at boot time.</li>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce the availability of Lagom 1.5.0-M4. This new milestone towards the releasing of Lagom 1.5.0 continues to improve support for gRPC in Lagom. This release includes Play 2.7.0-M4, Akka 2.5.17 and Akka-HTTP 10.1.5.</p>
<p>Note that ConductR will not be supported for Lagom 1.5.0. Also note that this is an unsupported, pre-release milestone and we don&rsquo;t guarantee API stability or binary compatibility between milestones.</p>
<h2><a href="#highlights" name="highlights">Highlights</a></h2>
<h3><a href="#updates-play-and-akka" name="updates-play-and-akka">Updates Play and Akka</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bump dependencies: Play was bumped to 2.7.0-M4 (<a href="https://blog.playframework.com/play-2-7-0-m4-released/">release notes</a>) and, since Lagom 1.5.0-M2, we&rsquo;ve bumped Akka to 2.5.17 (<a href="https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/09/27/akka-2.5.17-released">release notes</a>) and Akka-HTTP to 10.1.5(<a href="https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/09/06/akka-http-10.1.5-10.0.14-security-fix-released">release notes</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#grpc" name="grpc">gRPC</a></h2>
<p>Previous milestones of Lagom 1.5.0 started laying the groundwork for integration with <a href="https://github.com/akka/akka-grpc">Akka gRPC</a> to add it as a transport alternative. In Lagom 1.5.0-M4 we&rsquo;ve improved the Lagom testkit so you can also test the gRPC of your Lagom application.</p>
<p>In this release, the following are introduced as part of the effort to support gRPC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is now possible to run the <code>TestServer</code> with SSL enabled and build a gRPC client to interact with the gRPC endpoints offered.</li>
  <li>Lagom 1.5.0-M3 enabled SSL by default in Lagom&rsquo;s Dev Mode. In Lagom 1.5.0-M4 we&rsquo;ve restored the previous behavior where only HTTP is used in Dev Mode and made SSL an Opt-In feature in Dev Mode. Use <code>lagomServiceEnableSsl in ThisBuild := true</code> to start your service with both HTTP and HTTPS ports bound.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#miscellaneous-improvements" name="miscellaneous-improvements">Miscellaneous improvements</a></h2>
<p>This release includes a few other small improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1475">1475</a> handle no body as a valid input contributed by Ido Shamun</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1572">1572</a> which improves Dev Mode&rsquo;s Service Gateway to stack Host header into X-Forwarded-Host so the target service running behind service Gateway still sees the data sent on the original request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lagom 1.5.0-M2 started laying groundwork for integration with <a href="https://github.com/akka/akka-grpc">Akka gRPC</a> to add it as a transport alternative, allowing seamless communication between applications written using Akka, Play, Lagom and other stacks using gRPC.</p>
<p>In this release,the following are introduced as part of the effort to support gRPC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is now possible to add additional Play <code>Router</code>s to a Lagom Service (next to the Lagom Router built from the <code>Service.Descriptor</code>). This allows wiring a <a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-grpc/current/play-framework.html">Play router that handles gRPC</a> traffic next to the Lagom router provided out of the box.</li>
  <li>Lagom&rsquo;s Dev Mode now binds an SSL port for each service next to HTTP port already bound. This changes the default behavior in Dev Mode and there’s <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/1537">ongoing effort</a> to restore the default which only binds HTTP and make the use of SSL an opt-in.</li>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce the availability of Lagom 1.5.0-M2 (we skipped Lagom 1.5.0-M1 due to an issue with the release process). This is the first milestone towards the releasing of Lagom 1.5.0 which moves Lagom closer to Play and Akka. This release includes Play 2.7.0-M2 and lays the groundwork for gRPC support in future 1.5.0 milestones with Akka Service Discovery integration.</p>
<p>The motivation behind moving Lagom closer to Play and Akka is twofold: Play and Akka users will be able to adopt Lagom more easily by reusing existing code or APIs they are already familiar with, and framework maintainers will reduce the amount of code to maintain and converge in conventions speeding up the development process.</p>
<p>Note that this should not be used in production, that Lightbend Orchestration (sbt-reactive-app) does not yet support Lagom 1.5.0-M2, and that ConductR will not be supported for Lagom 1.5.0. Also note that this is an unsupported, pre-release milestone and we don&rsquo;t guarantee API stability or binary compatibility between milestones.</p>
<h2><a href="#highlights" name="highlights">Highlights</a></h2>
<h3>Updates Play to 2.7.x</h3>
<p>Lagom 1.5.0-M2 bumps the Play version to <a href="https://blog.playframework.com/play-2-7-0-m2-released/">2.7.0-M2</a> (see also <a href="https://blog.playframework.com/play-2-7-0-milestone-1-released/">2.7.0-M1</a>). Play now exposes the <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown">Akka Coordinated Shutdown</a> instance as a first class citizen so you can register your shutdown code using it instead of using Play&rsquo;s <code>ApplicationLifecycle</code>.</p>
<p>The version of Akka HTTP powering the default HTTP Backend for both Play and Lagom was bumped to <a href="https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/03/08/akka-http-10.1.0-released">10.1</a>.</p>
<p>Upgrading to Play 2.7 may cause some errors on your code as some deprecated APIs were removed (please review the <a href="https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/master/documentation/manual/releases/release27/migration27/Migration27.md">Play 2.7 Migration Guide</a> or the release announcements linked above). Play also updated the Jackson library (for java JSON serialization) to 2.9.6 which includes reviewed defaults so you may need to check your serializer settings. The changes in Jackson default settings may not cause compilation errors so we recommend you exercise your serializers in tests to detect any potential issue.</p>

<p>We are laying groundwork for integration with <a href="https://github.com/akka/akka-grpc">Akka gRPC</a> to add it as a transport alternative, allowing seamless communication between applications written using Akka, Play, Lagom and other stacks using gRPC.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-management/current/discovery.html">Akka&rsquo;s Service Discovery</a> will become a building block of Lagom&rsquo;s <code>ServiceLocator</code> and help standardize service discovery scenarios. This will simplify production settings to tune cluster bootstrap and other service discovery strategies and combine them. Lagom 1.5.0-M2 started the refactor process to move to an implementation that&rsquo;s based 100% on Akka&rsquo;s Service Discovery. This new library provides an extensible API for looking up service addresses by name from within Akka-based services, including integration with Kubernetes, Marathon, Consul, and others. It is similar to Lagom&rsquo;s ServiceLocator API, but can be used in any Akka or Play application, as well as in Lagom. It is a foundational building block for many of the upcoming cross-product features, including gRPC support, and with this release it works seamlessly in Lagom&rsquo;s runAll development mode without additional configuration. We are planning to integrate this more fully with Lagom in future 1.5.0 milestones and beyond.</p>
<p>This cross-product collaboration is the first of many more to come. The motivation is to allow users developers to more naturally reuse code between Akka, Play and Lagom. The promotion of Akka Coordinated Shutdown mentioned above is another example of this effort to provide more coherent APIs.</p>
<h3><a href="#other-improvements" name="other-improvements">Other improvements</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Updates Alpakka Kafka to version <a href="https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/releases">0.22</a>. This also includes a version upgrade of the Kafka Server embedded in Development Mode to 1.0.1.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Improves Development Mode settings so each service can choose what network interface to bind to, which is particularly useful in some OS or corporate environments where VPNs or proxies can interfere with inter-service communication. The new default for all services is to listen only on the loopback address <code>127.0.0.1</code> by default, which has better compatibility, but disallows communication from other hosts on the network. This can be configured to use another address if you need to share a Lagom development environment on a local network. Every service run in Developer Mode has slightly different settings, see the docs for <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/latest/java/ServiceLocator.html#Default-address1">Service Gateway</a>, <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/latest/java/ServiceLocator.html#Default-address">Service Locator</a> or <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/latest/java/ConfiguringServicesInDevelopment.html#How-are-addresses-bound-by-services?">your services</a>.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Many documentation improvements, especially to remove deprecated APIs in code examples.</p></li>
